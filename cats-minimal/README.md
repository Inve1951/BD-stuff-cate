# Cat's minimal discord theme
This is a quick thrown together css theme for discord (requires betterdiscord to use).

The normal minimal theme build in with betterdiscord felt a bit lacking in my opinion, hence 
I made this.
Personaly I only made this to get as much normal looking discord as possible while keeping it on half of my second monitor.

This is by no means complete or done, and shouldn't be seen as such.

it should work with most other themes (like the build in discord minimal)
