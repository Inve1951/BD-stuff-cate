# Cat's minimal discord theme
This is a quick thrown together css theme for discord (requires betterdiscord to use).

The normal minimal theme build in with betterdiscord felt a bit lacking in my opinion, hence 
I made this.
Personaly I only made this to get as much normal looking discord as possible while keeping it on half of my second monitor.

This is by no means complete or done, and shouldn't be seen as such.

### key 'features':
* scaled down overall gui
* chat moved to left to get the best chat experience on half your tiny second monitor
* should work with most other custom themes

### side 'features':
* bigger quick emote menu
* stupid hover animations for avatars and emoticons/emojis **optional** (to enable uncomment 
at the bottom of .css)

### known 'problems':
* parts misplaced or hidden
* awkwardly sized/positioned parts
