# Plugins:
## fix size
for some reason discord has a minimal window size these days, this fixes it. just set a size and it'll be restored on start.

## Tab Complete
Adds tabcompletion for favorited emotes
     
made by EshanKia, I only update it

## Start Online
sets your status to Online on startup, handy for multiple clients or when you set yourself invisible on phone

## Translate with Google
Adds a "Translate with Google" option, similar to the existing "Search with Google"

## actual-httpcats-background
shitty rewrite of a plugin that was used to steal tokens, this version isnt harmful

set random cat pics from http.cat as background every 10 seconds. ''''inspired'''' by martmists' plugin. only works with transparent themes.

## Start Maximized
maximizes the client on startup

## Random Emotes
Send one or more random emotes with /emote amount

## Animate Avatars
Terribly inefficient way to always animate avatars, which is also terribly inefficient.

noodlebox has made a better version of this, please refer to that one

## ~~No Emoji~~Discord broke it
~~Replaces emoji pics with whatever is in their alt attribute,  most of the time the symbol version of emoji.~~

## ~~Mention all~~BetterAPI broke it
~~Attempt to mention all users in channel/server, this kinda works,
note that this plugin needs bd+ to work~~
